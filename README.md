Spam Email Detection:

  

Description:

This project aims to classify emails as spam or not spam using machine learning techniques. The system leverages a dataset of emails to train a model that can identify spam based on features such as email content and metadata. This tool can be used by individuals and organizations to reduce unwanted emails and improve productivity.

Features:

Preprocessing of email datasets to clean and tokenize text.

Implementation of feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF.

Training and testing of various machine learning models (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).

Evaluation metrics for performance analysis (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).

Easy integration into email systems.

Dataset:

The project uses a dataset named spam.csv containing labeled email data. The dataset includes the following fields:

label: Indicates whether the email is "spam" or "ham" (not spam).

message: The text content of the email.
